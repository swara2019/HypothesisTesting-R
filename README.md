# HypothesisTesting-R
Hypothesis Testing with Tuberculosis Dataset: Here, we have explored the data set - TB Case notification, provided by World health Organization and conducted some analysis to identify the factors associated with TB disease. There is a general idea that people living with HIV are more likely than others to become sick with TB. Considering this as our prior hypothesis, we have tested if the hypothesis has a statistical significance, by analyzing the data set from the year 2005 to 2014. Next, we have measured the extent to which total number of HIV cases and total number of cases of TB patients who are also diagnosed with HIV are related to verify our prior hypothesis by using correlation coefficient (Pearson Test with 0.05 significance level ) to measure the pattern of responses across variables.
